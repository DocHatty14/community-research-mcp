# Community Research MCP Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Community Research MCP**. This system empowers AI assistants to perform deep, parallel, and validated research across multiple community sources (Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit, Hacker News, and the Web).

## 📚 Documentation Structure

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**Getting Started**](getting-started.md) | Installation, setup, and first steps. |
| [**Features**](features.md) | Deep dive into Streaming, Deep Research, and Active Browsing. |
| [**Architecture**](architecture.md) | System design, parallel execution flow, and module dependencies. |
| [**API Reference**](api-reference.md) | Detailed reference for all MCP tools and functions. |

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

- **Parallel Streaming Search**: Query Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit, Hacker News, and DuckDuckGo simultaneously.
- **Deep Research Loop**: Recursive research that identifies gaps and fills them automatically.
- **Active Browsing**: Fetches full page content for deeper context, not just snippets.
- **Smart Clustering**: Organizes results into semantic clusters (e.g., "Official Docs", "Community Workarounds").
- **Multi-Model Validation**: Uses a secondary model to critique and validate findings.
