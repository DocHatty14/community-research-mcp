In theory - as mentioned by others - you can substitute Regex with basic string operations or different operations with various libraries. Usually I go to RegexOne for a quick reminder. Next I usually go to Pythex - there you can quickly test your Python Regex live with a sample string you provide and there is even a quick cheat sheet provided. So all in all you can keep a file with 3-4 lines of code snippets like: # dataframe ds from pandas-library ds['COLUMN_NAME'].str.replace('REGEX HERE', regex=True) # to replace strings in a column re.sub('REPLACE THIS REGEX PATTERN', 'WITH THIS REGEX PATTERN', input) # simple replace re.match('SEARCH FOR THIS REGEX PATTERN', 'IN THIS STRING') # returns a match if a match is found at BEGINNING of string re.search('SEARCH FOR THIS REGEX PATTERN', 'IN THIS STRING') # returns a match if pattern is found ANYWHERE in string As for alternatives, the answer might be \\\"no\\\", depending on how you're using them.

If you can learn python, you can probably fully learn the fundamentals of regular expressions in a single day. If your problem is large (\\\"the order can be in one of these four formats, with various optional and recursive parts\\\"), just bite the bullet and write a proper parser.

I am mainly developing on Python, but I'd hope to see a library which could be ported to other languages/platforms.
